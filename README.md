# dialert

**DiALERT** checks a schedule and changes a PBX ring group accordingly. It was created for @rpiambulance for use by their duty supervisors.

### Name

**DiALERT**'s name is quadruply clever:

1. "di-" is a prefix meaning "two," "double," or similar. **DiALERT** runs _twice_ per day, requires the use of _two_ servers (the schedule and **DiALERT** itself), and manages _two_ ring groups (the normal and backup lists).
1. "Dial" stems from the use of telephone technology.
1. "Alert" comes from the ring groups' usage: to alert supervisors that someone needs them.
1. "ERT" is an abbreviation we use to mean "emergency response telephony."

I don't knowâ€”I thought of all that laying in bed one night. Do with it what you will.
